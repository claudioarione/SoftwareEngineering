-- We can observe that the number of seconds left until the vehicle is charged is equal to the number of seconds until a fast-charging socket is free (4) and
-- that the power absorbed by the vehicle (1) is less than the maximum power available in the socket (2), as expected

-- schedule and both the schedule and the suggestion are in the time interval 1-2.
-- Suggestion1 and Suggestion2 are two suggestions on the same socket (ChargingSocket0) but regarding different time intervals. They are
